This text holds all history and changes to GAN training parameters.
On attempt 6 we started the single parameter training search.
Though the parameters are the same, from 6 onwards they are retrained to record 
the discriminator loss as it was not recorded before.

# Base parameters

# Attempt 6: Same as base.
