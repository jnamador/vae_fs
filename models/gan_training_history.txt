This text holds all history and changes to GAN training parameters.
On attempt 6 we started the single parameter training search.
Though the parameters are the same, from 6 onwards they are retrained to record 
the discriminator loss as it was not recorded before.

# PAST HISTORY --------
# Attempt History. The original code for each folder should also be tied to the commits. 
# 0: First attempt. GAN as copied from other repo https://github.com/max-cohen54/AD_trigger_training/blob/main/L1AD/software/VAE_GAN/L1_VAE_Analyzer_FDL_GAN_ALT.ipynb
# 1: Added GAN loss to 
# 2: Various parametric sweeps
# 3: Better file naming convention and varied clipnorm
# Notes: Smaller clipnorm ~ 0.1 tended to bring down the losses rather than blowing up.
# Keeping clipnorm to 0.1 in future trainings
# 4: Varying gamma maxes
# 5: gamma = 0 sanity check
# -------------------

# Attempt 6: Same as base.

# Attempt 7: Changes from base: LR Decreased
LR             = 0.00001 # Learning rate
# --

# Attempt 8: Changes from base: LR Decreased
LR             = 0.000001 # Learning rate
# --

# Attempt 9: Changes from base: LR Decreased
LR             = 0.0000001 # Learning rate
